# Rock-Paper-Scissors
In the Rock-Paper-Scissors project, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts are applied using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The game involves players choosing between rock, paper, or scissors, with the outcome determined by classic rules. It utilizes HTML to create the game interface, including buttons for choices and a display area for results. CSS is used for aesthetic design and responsiveness. JavaScript, embodying OOP principles, features classes such as Game for logic, Player for representing users and their choices, and potentially UI for interface updates. The project involves setting up interactive elements through event listeners, enabling the game to respond to user choices and display outcomes, making it an engaging way to understand and implement OOP in web development.
